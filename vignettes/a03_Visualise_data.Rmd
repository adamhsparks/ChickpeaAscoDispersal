# Note that GhostScript needs to be installed at the system level for the PS files to be generated.
# MacOS users can use `brew install ghostscript`
# 
# Windows users can follow these directions:
# 1.	Go to the GhostScript website (https://www.ghostscript.com/download/gsdnld.html)
# 2.	Download the windows installer suitable for your machine
# 3.	Run the installer file which you downloaded and follow the prompts
# 4.	After running the installer click the windows "Start" button and type "Edit environment variables for your account" and open
# 5.	In the tab 'Advanced' click the button at the bottom 'Enviroment Variables...'
# 6.	Under 'System variables' find the variable 'Path', select 'Path' and click the 'Edit' button
# 7. 	Select a new line and copy the Ghostscript 'bin' folder location into the field.
# 7.1	If you installed ghostscript to the default folder location; then the folder location will likely be "C:\Program Files\gs\gs9.52\bin", the version number (9.52) may differ.
# 8.	Save and exit the environmental variables window


# This chunk is then run only if knitting on new computer that the files have not been generated on
# this is necessary to embed fonts in .eps files for EJPP

## Visualise Counts per Pot

```{r lesion-count, fig.cap="Density plot of mean lesions counted per plant for all six events.", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(lesion_counts, aes(x = m_lesions)) +
   geom_density() +
   xlab("Mean lesion count per plant")
```

## Visualise the Dispersal Data

```{r combined-dispersal, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Mean number of conidia dispersed (counted as lesions) per plant during each spread event. Where the mean lesions per plant for each pot is shown on the y-axis and distance dispersed is on the x-axis. ‘n’ indicates the count of pots with the same mean lesions per trap plant, and is represented by point size. Red points and line show median lesions counted per trap plant. Conidia travelled up to 75 m in each of the six irrigation and rainfall event."}
ggplot(lesion_counts, aes(x = distance,
                          y = m_lesions)) +

   options = "-dEPSCrop"
)
```

## Visualise the Rainfall

```{r rain, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap=paste0("Ten-minute precipitation data for each of the six rainfall or irrigation events at two locations. Events are denoted by the location, 'Horsham' or 'Curyo'; and whether the site was irrigated, 'Irrg' or rainfed 'Rain' or 'Mixd' (both simultaneously); and event '1', '2' or '3.' Precipitation values, 11&nbsp;mm that were applied, are not shown, only rainfall data are presented.")}

dat <- left_join(lesion_counts, cleaned_weather, by = c("site", "rep"))

dat %>%
   group_by(SpEv) %>%
   mutate(Hour = floor_date(time, "1 hour")) %>%
   group_by(SpEv, Hour) %>%
   summarize(sum(rainfall)) %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = Hour, y = `sum(rainfall)`)) +
   geom_col() +
   scale_x_datetime(
      "Date (day-month)",
      date_breaks = "day",
      date_labels = "%d-%m",
      date_minor_breaks = "hour",
      guide = guide_axis(check.overlap = TRUE)
   ) +
   ylab("Precipitation (mm)") +
   facet_wrap(. ~ SpEv, ncol = 3, scales = "free_x")
```

## Visualise the Wind Speed and Direction

```{r wind, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap=paste0("Windroses for spread events showing ten-minute wind speed and direction at the two Horsham sites. Curyo wind speed and direction data are not shown due to a weather station calibration issue resulting in incorrect data for wind direction.")}
pw <-
   with(
      dat,
      windrose(
         wind_speed,
         wind_direction,
         SpEv,
         n_col = 3,
         legend_title = "Wind speed (m/s)"
      )
   )
pw +
   scale_fill_viridis_d(name = "Wind Speed (m/s)", direction = -1) +
   xlab("") +
   theme_pubclean()
```

When inspecting these data, we noted that the wind direction for Curyo was against the direction of spread along the transects, which led to further investigation of the weather data.
That investigation is detailed in [this analysis](06_Validate_Curyo_weather.html).

## Heatmap of Lesions Along Transects

```{r polar_coord_transects, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap=paste0("Heatmap showing count of mean lesions per plant for each pot along each of ten transects. Note that any stations where the mean count was zero for any event, the data are not shown for clarity. Events are denoted by the location, 'Horsham' or 'Curyo'; source of precipitation 'Irrg' (irrigation), 'Rain' (rainfall) or 'Mixd' (both simultaneously); and event '1', '2' or '3.'")}
