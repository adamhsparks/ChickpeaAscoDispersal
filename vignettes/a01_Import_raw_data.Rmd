This vignette documents the raw data import, calculation of mean lesion values and exports the new data to "data/lesion_counts.rda" for further use in visualisation and analysis.

In the first step, the data is imported, the "m" from the `distance` column is dropped and the column is converted to numeric.
A new column, `SpEv` (Spread Event), is created for each location and replicated event at that location. Another new column, `degrees`, is added for each transect to indicate the direction in degrees based on J. Fanning's best information.
Lastly the mean lesions counted per plant within the pot, `m_lesions` is calculated for each of the transects at each distance, 0, 10, 25, 50 and 75 meters from the plots.

After the data are updated, a column for precipitation type, `ptype`, is added and the spread events, `SpEv`, are renamed for clarity and ordered as factors for data visualisation.

Save lesion count data for use in visualisation and modelling.
This only needs to be done once.

```{r save-lesion-counts, eval=FALSE}
save(lesion_counts, file = "../data/lesion_counts.rda")
```
